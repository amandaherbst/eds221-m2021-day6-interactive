## Warm Up

Recreate text of the first 3 pages in the book "Brown bear, brown bear, what do you see?"

```{r}
animal <- c("brown bear", "red bird", "yellow duck", "blue horse")

for (i in 2:length(animal)) {
  print(paste0(animal[i-1], ", ", animal[i-1], ", what do you see? I see a ", animal[i], " looking at me."))
}
```
